        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>I am researcher and physicist (and kind of an engineer, but not quite). I have a PhD in Quantum Photonics, a field of physics concerned with studying the quantum-mechanical 
            properties of light. I built a machine that was able to generate quantum light in the lab.</p> 

        <p>Now I'm working in industry to try to build a photonic quantum computer; a machine that uses single particles of light to do computations. It's believed that if we
            can build a large enough machine, where errors occur slowly enough so that we can correct them as we go, we'll be able to perform calculations that classical computers cannot.</p> 

        <p>More generally, I'm interested in the interection between computing and photonics, and whether specialised photonic hardware can be used for bespoke computing applications.</p>
