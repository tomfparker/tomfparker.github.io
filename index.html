        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>I am researcher and physicist (and almost an engineer), currently based in London, UK. My background is in quantum optics and photonics; the study of the quantum mechanical 
          nature of light. Now I'm working in industry to try to build a photonic quantum computer; a machine that uses single particles of light to do computations. 
          More generally, I'm interested in the intersection between computing and photonics, and whether specialised photonic hardware can be used for 
          bespoke computing applications.</p>
